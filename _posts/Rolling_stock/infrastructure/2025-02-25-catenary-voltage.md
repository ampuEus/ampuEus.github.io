Voltages and frequencies are **defined by** two standards: **EN 50163** and **IEC 60850**.

The frequency of the 50 Hz electric traction system is imposed by the three phase grid. Therefore, the
values stated by EN 50160 are applicable. The frequency of the 16,7 Hz electric traction system (except
for synchronous- synchronous converters) is not imposed by the three phase grid.

## AC or DC traction

**It doesn’t really matter whether you have AC or DC motors, nowadays either can work with an AC or DC supply.** You just need to put the right sort of control system between the supply and the motor and it will work. However, the choice of AC or DC power transmission system along the line is important. Generally, it’s a question of what sort of railway you have. It can be summarized simply as **AC for long distance** and **DC for short distance**.

> AC systems always use overhead wires, DC can use either an overhead wire or a third rail. And the **return circuit is via the running rails back to the substation**. The running rails are at earth potential and are connected to the substation.

It is **easier to boost the voltage of AC** than that of DC, so it is easier to send more power over transmission lines with AC.

DC, on the other hand was the preferred option for shorter lines, urban systems and tramways. Apart from only requiring a **simple control system for the motors**, the **smaller size of urban operations** meant that **trains** were usually **lighter and needed less power**. But it needed a **heavier transmission medium** to carry the power and it lost a fair amount of voltage as the distance between supply connections increased.

> This was overcome by placing substations at close intervals – every three or four kilometers at first, nowadays two or three on a 750 V system – compared with every 20 kilometers or so for a 25 kV AC line.
